Milk tea and boba, a drink that has originated in Taiwan, has since become one of the most popular and trending food items in the US.
This popularity is seen in places with a high Asian population, mainly the West Coast. This project aims to track the popularity of the drink in the San Francisco Bay Area.
This side project utilizes ETL strategies to gain a deeper insight into the Bay Area boba scene, from tracking which cities have
